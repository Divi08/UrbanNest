## üîß Configuration

### Capacitor Configuration

The app is configured in `capacitor.config.ts`:
- App ID: `com.urbannest.app`
- App Name: `UrbanNest`
- Web Directory: `dist` (Vite build output)

### Mobile-Specific Features

The app includes several mobile-specific features:

1. **Capacitor Plugins**:
   - App lifecycle management
   - Haptic feedback
   - Keyboard handling
   - Status bar configuration
   - Splash screen management

2. **Mobile CSS Classes**:
   - `.mobile-safe-area` - Safe area insets for notched devices
   - `.mobile-scroll` - Smooth scrolling on mobile
   - `.mobile-tap-highlight` - Remove tap highlights
   - `.mobile-button` - Minimum touch target size (44px)

3. **Platform Detection**:
   - Automatic platform detection
   - Native vs web platform handling

## üì¶ Build Process

1. **Web Build**: Vite builds the React app to `dist/` directory
2. **Capacitor Sync**: Copies web assets to native platforms
3. **Native Build**: Use Xcode/Android Studio to build native apps

## üé® Mobile UI Considerations

The app has been optimized for mobile with:
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px)
- Safe area support for notched devices
- Proper keyboard handling
- Mobile-optimized scrolling
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
